# Welcome to the Molecular Recognition Lab!
Starting can always be daunting, so hopefully this wiki will help. The idea is that all of us in the group make it grow to have a reference point that serves as a how to and has a set of tutorials to help new peers get started! What you contribute here will help many generations of scientist to come! :)

Mission statement

We are here to learn and grow personally at the same time that we expand the boundaries of scientific knowledge.
We will strive to produce high impact robust, reproducible science. The aim is that everyone that joins the group learns to: formulate hypothesis-driven research, carry it out, analyze the data and present it in papers, and conferences, lab and department meetings. 
We are commited to maintain a supportive and helpful work environment respecting work-life balance.
